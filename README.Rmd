This repository is a collection of my notes and code for developing new diagnostic markers to differenciate two subspecies of surf clam.

The most relavent files for reference are my [Notes_MarkerDevelopment.txt](https://github.com/hannahhartung/Spisula/blob/master/Notes_MarkerDevelopment.txt) and [Scripts_MarkerDevelopment.txt](https://github.com/hannahhartung/Spisula/blob/master/Scripts/Scripts_MarkerDevelopment.txt) which show my process and final code for creating the markers respectively.
