Pseudo Code - Marker Development

Transcriptome Creation

Alignment

Creation of vcf files using freebayes
Parallelize by contig
Merge vcf files from individual contig files

Filter vcf files
Diagnostically relevant (with awk)
Quality and depth filters (vcf and bcf tools)

Create Primer Product
In batches of large (>> 200 bp) contigs run my code for pulling out Primer3 products with SNPs in them
Filter also for contigs that contain SNPs
Pull out that contig from the reference to create a working reference
echo into job list the Primer3 input including working reference
find primers that work well on that contig
confirm the presense of at least one SNP on that primer product for similis
create a file of similis and solidissima at that primer product location
concatenate those into a file for SNP2CAPS

Use Primer Products of Similis vs Solidissima as input for SNPS2CAPS 
reduce total primer database to be those with a reasonable price available from NEBL
input concatenated primer products
filter results by ones easy to see on gel 
	i. 1-2 cuts 
	ii. difference between fragment length >40bp (ideally >50bp)

primer_attempts/contig.output
locate the primer #
pull primer pair details from Primer3 output file
Refer to them now as dRFLP (diagnostic RFLP)
