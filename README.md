Spisula Reposity - Hannah Hartung with Hare Lab at Cornell
================

This repository is a collection of my notes and code for developing new
diagnostic markers to differenciate two subspecies of surf clam.

The most relavent files for reference are my
Notes\_MarkerDevelopment.txt and Scripts\_MarkerDevelopment.txt which
show my process and final code for creating the markers respectively.
